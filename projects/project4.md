# **MEAN STACK DEPLOYMENT TO UBUNTU IN AWS**
MEAN web stack is a technology stack that combines a set of frameworks and tools specifically chosen to work 
<br>together and used to develop a software product.  
<br>

# **Step 1 - Preparing prerequisites** 
In order to complete this project, an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS is required.  
<br>

Creation of a new AWS account gives access to the free tier plan which allows to spin up a new EC2 instance
<br>(an instance of a virtual server) for free in only a matter of a few clicks.  
<br>

You can watch the videos below to learn how to Provision a server and connect to it.
